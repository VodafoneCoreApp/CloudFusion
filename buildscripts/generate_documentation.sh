#Generates and publishes documentation from development branch to gh-pages, which is automatically shown as webpage by github, if it contains a tag.                                                      #This means you need to push with --tags option from your local repository. Otherwise the tags are not pushed.                                                                                            #i.e. git tag -a v1.4;git push --tags
