CloudFusion lets you access your Dropbox or Sugarsync files like any file on your desktop.

To install CloudFusion on Ubuntu do the following:

sudo apt-get install git
git clone git://github.com/joe42/CloudFusion.git
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
cd CloudFusion/cloudfusion/
sudo python setup.py install
mkdir -p .cloudfusion/logs mnt
python -m cloudfusion.main mnt

Add the username and password in the Dropbox or Sugarsync configuration file located at cloudfusion/cloudfusion/config/. Also add the keys you get from when creating an application (for Sugarsync you need to get a developer account first).

Now copy the configuration file to your mountpoint:

cp ~/db.ini mnt/config/config

This assumes that you saved the configuration file with your login data as db.ini to your home directory.

Now you should be able access your files in the directory mnt/data.
